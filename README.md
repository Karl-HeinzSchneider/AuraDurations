# \# AuraDurations

Simple addon to bring back buff/debuff swipe timers for the **default** TargetFrame and CompactRaidFrame on Era.

## Features

(Era only)

Zero configuration; just adds the cooldown swipe texture to buffs and debuffs on the TargetFrame and CompactRaidFrame. Similar to _ClassicAuraDurations_ (which seems abandoned). 

Uses the default API and is based on blizzard code from TBC onwards; also uses [LibClassicDurations](https://github.com/rgd87/LibClassicDurations) to improve results.

 

## For addon developers

Source code released under MIT licence.

Can be embeded (as the initial purpose was adding this functionality to [DragonflightUI classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dragonflight-ui-classic)).
